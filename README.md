Data Loading and Preprocessing: Utilized Pandas to load and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Created visualizations using Plotly to understand the relationship between ride duration, cost, and vehicle type.
Correlation Analysis: Analyzed correlations between various features to identify significant predictors.
Model Development: Built a RandomForestRegressor model to predict ride prices dynamically, considering factors like the number of riders, number of drivers, vehicle type, and expected ride duration.
Prediction and Evaluation: Developed a function to predict prices based on user inputs and evaluated the model's performance by comparing actual vs. predicted values.
This dynamic pricing model helps the ride-hailing service adjust prices in real-time, ensuring competitiveness and maximizing revenue during high-demand periods.
